# FCC Camper Leaderboard

This a project using React to build a leaderboard for the top performing "campers" on FreeCodeCamp.

Requirements:

1. A table shows the FreeCodeCamp campers who have earned the most points in the last 30 days.

2. For each user on the leaderboard, I can see how many point they have earned in the past 30 days and how many they have earned total.

3. The leaderboard can be toggled to sort the list either by points earned in last 30 days or point earned total.
